# Simulated-Signals-Dataset

This is a storage for multidimensional reference signals and processes within the framework of digital filtering based on fast simulation algorithms and a universal adaptive matrix transformation operator. The storage contains relevant simulation equations, simulated signals images, and original code in Python. Only 2D Fourier basis simulation is presented for now.
Other languages, as well as a table of computational complexity and accuracy estimations, are to be added in due course.

The folder "Mathematics" contains matrixes of Fourier kernels relating to a matrix transformation operator.

"2D Fourier" contains data on 2D Fourier simulation.

"Licences" contains obtained licences for the software developed within the project.

Every experiments folder contains .csv and .svg results.
